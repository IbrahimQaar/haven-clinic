# 🏥 Haven Clinic
**Status:** Under Active Development

Haven Clinic is a full-stack healthcare web application designed to support patient-facing workflows commonly found in modern clinical platforms. The system provides structured access to medical services, provider information, clinic locations, and patient resources through a consistent and production-oriented interface.

The application is built in alignment with healthcare UX and accessibility standards, with a focus on clarity, usability, and predictable navigation. Layout structure and interaction patterns follow conventions used in real-world healthcare systems to ensure intuitive use and maintainability.

From a technical perspective, the project follows a layered architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components. REST-based APIs and modular design principles are used to support maintainability and future expansion.
